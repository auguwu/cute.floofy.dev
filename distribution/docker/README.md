> *Easy, self-hostable, and flexible image host made in Rust*

**ume** is a simple and flexible image host to be used with ShareX or Flameshot to provide a blazing-fast way to send images to your friends on various different platforms like Discord, Telegram, etc.

**ume**'s plan is to be minimal as possible when self-hosting, so no external configuration is *required* but is there if you wish to customize every aspect of **ume**.

## Usage
This will spawn a Ume server that will listen under `:3621`:

```shell
$ docker run --name ume -e UME_UPLOADER_KEY="a random string" -d -p 3621:3621 auguwu/ume
```

The `ume` CLI is available as the Docker image, you can overwrite the default `CMD` instruction:

```shell
$ docker run --rm auguwu/ume ume -h
```

and will print the following:

```shell
üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏èüíê Easy, self-hostable, and flexible image host made in Rust
